# First we need to set up some kind of array to keep track of the word and the hidden list

# My objectives to include as the programmer
    # keep looping until the player has won or lost

    # Display the guessed letters, the current boards, and how many attempts are remaining

    # ask for user input (the letter they want to guess)

        # if the user's guess is correct, show all the matched letters and print the message

        # if the user's guess is wrong, print failure message and how many attempts are left

    # If user wins the game, print a win message and stop the loop from executing

    # If user looses, print failing message and stop the loop from executing.
